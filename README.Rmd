<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of geotargets is to extend targets to work with geospatial data, like shapefiles and rasters.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geotargets like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("njtierney/geotargets")
```

## Package still under development

Currently geotargets provides:

- `tar_geotiff`
- `tar_shapefile`

But these are under development.
